# Introduction

This is my new nvim configuration for 2024, this is based off of [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) which is a fantastic starting point for a neovim configuration, and I highly recommend it.

## Requirements

- Neovim (obviously) - I'm using nightly, however, stable (0.9+) should also work just fine as far as I'm aware as it hasn't been long since I've used stable.
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation) - this is required for telescope to work nicely
